HOW TO PUSH CHANGES TO THE WEB APP
====================================

1. Make your edits to any file (e.g. app.py)

2. Open Terminal and run:

   cd "/Users/joeclacher/Documents/Scripts/dug scripts"

3. Stage the changed file(s):

   git add app.py

   (or to stage everything at once: git add -A)

4. Commit with a message describing what you changed:

   git commit -m "your message here"

5. Push to GitHub:

   git push

The web app on Streamlit Cloud will redeploy automatically within ~30 seconds.
No need to do anything on the Streamlit site.
